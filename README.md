# Implementation of Recommendation Systems using ML Algorithms	 

Implemented a recommendation system using machine learning techniques, including collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, neural networks, and singular value decomposition (SVD) on the Kaggle job recommendation challenge dataset. Preprocessed and analyzed the data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Surprise, and visualized results with Matplotlib.
